## About the Video Course
React Native is a cross-platform application development framework built by engineers at Facebook. React Native will help you to get out of the pain of maintaining a Swift and Java code base by learning once and applying it anywhere.

With the help of React Native, you’ll be able to create visually stunning and high-performing applications. This course will get you started with React Native quickly by building React components for mobile devices. You’ll learn to configure Firebase to store your data while coding your applications. You’ll be able hot-reload applications and see the changes you’ve made without re-compiling your application again and again.

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to develop highly functional iOS and Android applications on your own and deploy them to both the App Store and the Play Store.
